I finished today but something went wrong
and I deleted the whole project
so I'll do it again from this commit

![Image Calculator](img/0.0.4.png)

0.0.4 added visual for the first level

0.0.3 the main function has been rewritten and now works correctly now we need to create 2 new levels
      "I think it will be interesting !"

0.0.2 wrote the basic function        (but there are problems!)

0.0.1 start development
